# Business-Optimization-Modeling-Problem-18
The repository contains the code for solving a Business Optimization Modeling Problem from my Optimization class. These problems require finding the variables, objective function, and constraints from the prompt, and then implementing these into a linear program to produce the optimized solution. The prompt is in the README file.
